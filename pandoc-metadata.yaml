  This document is the living constitution for the Web3Privacy Now collective. Its purpose is to create a resilient framework that empowers individuals to take action and drive our mission forward, without being slowed by bureaucracy. It is a system designed to channel passion into productive, impactful work.

  Our approach evolves the foundational principles of "The Hackerspace Blueprint" by Merlijn Sebrechts and Hackerspace Gent (used under CC BY-SA 4.0), adapting their wisdom for a global, digitally-native organization.
