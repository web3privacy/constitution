# 4. The Stewards

Stewards are the guardians of this Constitution and the overall health of the Web3Privacy Now community. They are servant-leaders, chosen for their wisdom, temperament, and dedication to our core principles.

**This is not a traditional board of directors.** Stewards do not set strategy, dictate projects, or manage day-to-day activities. Their role is purely to fulfill two specific, critical functions: to act as impartial counselors in disputes and as guardians of our foundational principles and assets. They hold the space, so the community can fill it.

## The Responsibilities of a Steward

A Steward's responsibilities are strictly limited to the following areas.

#### As Counselors: Conflict Resolution
When a significant interpersonal conflict arises that cannot be resolved directly between members, it can be escalated to the Stewards.

* **Process:** The Stewards' role is to act as impartial mediators. They will listen to all parties involved and facilitate a constructive dialogue.
* **Goal:** The aim is not to assign blame or enact punishment, but to find a mutually agreeable path forward that allows constructive collaboration to resume.
* **Confidentiality:** Stewards are expected to handle all such matters with the utmost discretion and confidentiality.

#### As Guardians: Principle & Asset Protection
This is the Stewards' second key function, which includes their role in the Formal Proposal process.

* **Veto Authority:** In the Formal Proposal process, Stewards act as the final check. Their role is not to decide if they *like* a proposal, but only to determine if it causes significant harm or directly violates the principles laid out in this Constitution. If they find that it does, they can uphold a Veto.
* **Core Asset Management:** Stewards are the designated signatories and protectors of the community's core shared assets. This may include:
    * Multi-signature control of the main treasury.
    * Ownership of primary domain names (e.g., web3privacy.now).
    * Administrative access to primary social media accounts and the community GitHub organization.

## Powers and Limitations

To maintain a true Do-ocracy, the limits of Steward power must be explicit.

#### Stewards have the power to:
* Mediate escalated interpersonal disputes.
* Uphold or overrule a Veto on a Formal Proposal, based on the principles of this Constitution.
* Execute transactions and manage administrative access for core assets, *only when instructed by a passed Formal Proposal*.

#### Stewards DO NOT have the power to:
* Dictate the mission or strategic direction of Web3Privacy Now.
* Initiate or shut down projects started under Intentional Do-ocracy.
* Spend treasury funds or alter core assets without the explicit approval of a Formal Proposal.
* Unilaterally remove a member (this would require its own Formal Proposal under extreme circumstances).

## Composition, Election, and Term

* **Composition:** There shall be **three (3)** Stewards. This odd number prevents deadlocks.
* **Election:** Stewards are elected via the Formal Proposal process. Candidates must be active, trusted members of the community.
* **Term:** Stewards serve for a **one-year term**. To ensure continuity, elections can be staggered (e.g., electing 1-2 Stewards every six months). A Steward may serve multiple terms if re-elected.

## Accountability and Removal

A Steward can be removed before their term is complete if they are acting in bad faith, are negligent in their duties, or are permanently unreachable. The removal of a Steward requires a Formal Proposal and must be approved by a **supermajority (â‰¥2/3rds)** of votes cast.
