# 5. Membership

Being part of the Web3Privacy Now ecosystem can take many forms. We value all types of engagement, from financial support to active contribution. To ensure our governance remains clear and effective, we distinguish between two primary roles within our community: **Supporters** and **Members**.

## Supporters

A Supporter is anyone who aids our mission, often through financial contributions (like recurring fees), spreading the word, or participating in public events.

* **Role:** Supporters are the lifeblood of our sustainability and our link to the wider public. Their belief in our mission provides the fuel for our work.
* **Privileges:** Supporters are valued parts of our extended community. They typically get access to exclusive content, newsletters, community updates, and a designated role in our communication channels.
* **Governance:** Supporters do not hold formal governance rights or responsibilities. They cannot create Formal Proposals or participate in the veto process.

## Members: The Core Contributors

Membership is not a status that can be bought; it is a recognition of sustained, meaningful contribution to the Web3Privacy Now mission. Members are the active drivers of our Intentional Do-ocracy and the stewards of our culture.

#### How to Become a Member

The path to becoming a Member is through contribution. A Supporter or new contributor is eligible for Membership after they have demonstrated their commitment and understanding of our ethos.

1. **Demonstrate Contribution:** The primary criterion is having successfully led or made a significant contribution to at least one initiative within the **Intentional Do-ocracy** framework (from Dream to Reflection).
2. **Be Vouched For:** An existing Member must vouch for the candidate, confirming their positive contributions and cultural alignment.
3. **Formal Recognition:** The candidate is then presented to the Stewards, who provide a simple, formal confirmation to finalize the Membership status. This is a light-touch check, not a heavy approval process.

#### Rights of a Member

Once recognized, a Member has the full governance rights outlined in this Constitution, including the right to:

* Initiate projects under Intentional Do-ocracy.
* Create a Formal Proposal.
* Formally object to a proposal during the review period.
* Participate in the election of Stewards.

#### Responsibilities of a Member

With these rights come responsibilities:

* To act in good faith and uphold the principles of this Constitution.
* To actively foster a healthy and collaborative environment.
* To use their governance rights thoughtfully and respectfully.

## Losing Membership

* **Dormancy:** Membership is not lost due to inactivity. Once a member, always a member. An inactive member simply does not participate in governance until they choose to become active again.
* **Revocation:** In extreme cases of acting in bad faith, deliberately harming the community, or violating its core principles, a Member's status can be revoked. This is a last resort and requires a Formal Proposal to be passed with a **supermajority (>=2/3rds)** vote.
