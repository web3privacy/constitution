# 8. The Legacy

This constitution did not arise in a vacuum. It stands on the shoulders of giants and is informed by the successes and failures of countless decentralized communities. This section serves as a collection of the core ideas and sources that shaped our thinking. It should be used as a "cipher" to better understand the principles behind our rules.

We are indebted to the following works and ideas:

* **Do-ocracy & Critiques:** The core principle of empowerment through action, along with the critiques that inspired our evolution to a more mindful "Intentional Do-ocracy."
* **[The Hackerspace Blueprint](https://hackerspace.design/):** The direct inspiration for our structure, providing a battle-tested framework for do-ocratic governance.
* **[Teal Organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS04BI2sbk):** The overarching philosophy for the kind of organization we aspire to be. Coined by Frederic Laloux, this model champions **Self-Management**, **Wholeness**, and **Evolutionary Purpose** over traditional, rigid hierarchies. Our constitution is a practical attempt to implement these ideals.
* **[Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** The inspiration for our contributor rewards model, demonstrating a way to fund people, not just projects.
* **Modern Agile & DevOps Principles:** The concepts of "blameless post-mortems" and short feedback loops that inform our approach to failure and iteration.
