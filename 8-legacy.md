# 8. The Legacy

This constitution did not arise in a vacuum. It stands on the shoulders of giants and is informed by the successes and failures of countless decentralized communities. This section serves as a collection of the core ideas and sources that shaped our thinking. It should be used as a "cipher" to better understand the principles behind our rules.

We are indebted to the following works and ideas:

* **The Open-Source Movement:** The foundational ethos of building in public, permissionless contribution, and peer review. Our entire operation, from our governance to our collaborative work, is a direct extension of this philosophy.

* **The Global Hackerspace Movement & Do-ocracy:** The culture of hands-on experimentation and peer-to-peer learning championed by hackerspaces worldwide gave rise to **Do-ocracy**, the governance model of empowerment through action. Our entire governance framework is built on this principle, along with the valuable critiques that helped us evolve it into our more mindful **"Intentional Do-ocracy."** We are especially indebted to the **[Hackerspace Blueprint](https://hackerspace.design/)**, which masterfully codified this wisdom.

* **[Teal Organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS04BI2sbk):** The overarching philosophy for the kind of organization we aspire to be. Coined by Frederic Laloux, this model champions **Self-Management**, **Wholeness**, and **Evolutionary Purpose** over traditional, rigid hierarchies, providing a formal language for many of our innate goals.

* **[Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** The inspiration for our contributor rewards model, demonstrating a powerful way to fund people, not just projects.

* **Modern Agile & DevOps Principles:** The concepts of "blameless post-mortems" and short feedback loops that inform our approach to failure, iteration, and continuous improvement.
