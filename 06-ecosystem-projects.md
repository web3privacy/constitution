# 6. Recognized Ecosystem Projects

Our Intentional Do-ocracy empowers any Member to start a mission-aligned initiative. This section creates a formal pathway for such initiatives to gain official recognition, ensuring they can be supported by the community's shared resources in a way that is fair, transparent, and scalable.

Recognition is not a requirement for an initiative to exist or operate. It is a formal status that creates a bridge between an independent project and the W3PN ecosystem's resources.

## The Recognition Process

An initiative may be granted the status of a “Recognized Ecosystem Project” via the **Formal Proposal** process defined in Section 3.

The proposal must demonstrate that the project meets the following criteria:

1. **Mission and Cultural Alignment:** It directly advances the W3PN mission and operates in a manner consistent with the spirit of our Guidelines (Section 8).
2. **Operational Independence:** It maintains its own brand and leadership and is not a shared asset of W3PN.

## Merits of Recognition

Achieving "Recognized" status grants the project the following merits:

* **Access to Shared Resources:** The project is empowered to submit Formal Proposals to request support from the Web3Privacy Now community, which can include budget allocations from the treasury, amplification, or other operational support.
* **A Formal Pathway to Membership:** Membership in a Recognized Project is distinct from W3PN Membership. However, sustained, valuable work within a Recognized Project shall be considered **demonstrable contribution** when a candidate is nominated for W3PN Membership under the process defined in Section 5. This provides a clear path for a project's key contributors to earn a formal voice in our collective governance.
