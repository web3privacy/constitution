# We are an Ecosystem for Impact

Web3Privacy Now is the hub where education, connection, and innovation converge to advance digital privacy. We are a community-driven organization that translates complex research into engaging content, connects builders with collaborators, and provides a powerful network for aligned projects.

We exist to build a flywheel of progress. By fostering a transparent and collaborative environment, we create a self-reinforcing cycle: education inspires new builders, connections create stronger projects, and our collective support accelerates their journey. We provide the fertile ground where ambitious ideas are nurtured, tested, and scaled.

## A Resilient Foundation

A core belief of Web3Privacy Now is that structure does not have to be an enemy of freedom. We recognize that for a decentralized, mission-driven community to thrive, it must be engineered to withstand the natural forces of conflict and stagnation. Hope and goodwill are starting points, not a complete strategy.

Our governance model is therefore built upon three fundamental acknowledgements—truths derived from observing the successes and failures of countless self-governing organizations:

* **"Common sense" is not common.** We must create explicit principles because our members come from diverse cultures and hold different assumptions.
* **Consensus is not always possible.** Passionate people will have conflicting goals. We need a clear process for making decisions when full agreement cannot be reached.
* **Inaction is the greatest risk.** An imperfect but clear process for solving problems is infinitely better than allowing them to fester unresolved.

This philosophy stems from the principle of Do-ocracy: a system where authority and influence are earned through action and contribution, not granted by title. Our approach is heavily inspired by the "Hackerspace Blueprint," a document where the community at Hackerspace Gent masterfully applied these Do-ocratic principles after overcoming their own challenges. We have adapted their framework for our unique context: a global collective dedicated to education, connection, and action in the Web3 privacy space.

The goal of this Constitution is to empower our community to get the best out of themselves. It is a system designed to stimulate collaboration and creative problem-solving. It is, by design, a work in progress. That is why this Constitution is hosted on GitHub, enabling our community to continuously refine it and for other organizations to learn from our journey.

# 1. Overview

The core operating system of Web3Privacy Now is **Do-ocracy**, detailed in Section 2. In short: if you want something to happen, you have the agency to start doing it yourself or to rally others to the cause. The goal of our Do-ocracy is to minimize friction and empower proactive contribution.

For actions that are irreversible, commit significant community resources, or fundamentally alter our shared digital infrastructure (like our brand or core platforms), a **Formal Proposal** is required, as explained in Section 3. This process ensures major decisions have community consensus and support.

Two areas require special care: interpersonal conflict and the safeguarding of core assets. Section 4 introduces the **Mediators**. They have two key responsibilities: acting as impartial **'counselors'** to help resolve interpersonal conflict, and as **'guardians'** to safeguard our core community assets. Crucially, and unlike a traditional board, the Mediators have no power to dictate the mission or day-to-day activities of the organization.

Section 5 explains how you become a contributing **Member** of our community.

To ensure our collaboration is smooth and constructive, we have a set of **Guidelines** (Section 6). These are not rigid rules, but a shared understanding of effective and respectful behavior within our ecosystem.

Finally, because the spirit of a rule is as important as its letter, we provide **The Legacy**. This is the collection of articles, discussions, and philosophies—including the Hackerspace Blueprint itself—that informed this Constitution. The Legacy serves as the "cipher" to interpret our principles and understand the rationale behind our structure.
