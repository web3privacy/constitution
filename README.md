# We are an Ecosystem for Impact

Web3Privacy Now is the hub where education, connection, and innovation converge to advance digital privacy. We are a community-driven organization that translates complex research into engaging content, connects builders with collaborators, and provides a powerful network for aligned projects.

We exist to build a flywheel of progress. By fostering a transparent and collaborative environment, we create a self-reinforcing cycle: education inspires new builders, connections create stronger projects, and our collective support accelerates their journey. We provide the fertile ground where ambitious ideas are nurtured, tested, and scaled.

## A Resilient Foundation

A core belief of Web3Privacy Now is that structure does not have to be an enemy of freedom. We recognize that for a decentralized, mission-driven community to thrive, it must be engineered to withstand the natural forces of conflict and stagnation. Hope and goodwill are starting points, not a complete strategy.

Our governance model is therefore built upon three fundamental acknowledgements—truths derived from observing the successes and failures of countless self-governing organizations:

* **"Common sense" is not common.** We must create explicit principles because our members come from diverse cultures and hold different assumptions.
* **Consensus is not always possible.** Passionate people will have conflicting goals. We need a clear process for making decisions when full agreement cannot be reached.
* **Inaction is the greatest risk.** An imperfect but clear process for solving problems is infinitely better than allowing them to fester unresolved.

This philosophy stems from the principle of Do-ocracy. Our approach is heavily inspired by the "Hackerspace Blueprint," a document where the community at Hackerspace Gent masterfully applied these principles. To make this system truly effective for a global, digitally-native collective, we have evolved their model into what we call **Intentional Do-ocracy**—our framework for turning ideas into effective action. 

The goal of this Constitution is to empower our community to get the best out of themselves. It is a system designed to stimulate collaboration and creative problem-solving, and you can **[download the latest version as a PDF](https://web3privacy.github.io/constitution/w3pn-constitution.pdf)** or **[ePub](https://web3privacy.github.io/constitution/w3pn-constitution.epub)**. It is, by design, a work in progress. That is why [this Constitution is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/web3privacy/constitution), enabling our community to continuously refine it and for other organizations to learn from our journey.

> We, the members of Web3Privacy Now, establish this Constitution not as a set of rigid laws, but as a living framework for effective, decentralized action. We commit to building a future where privacy is a default, not a feature. This document is our shared map for navigating that journey with purpose, principle, and passion.

# 1. Overview

The core operating system of Web3Privacy Now is our unique model called **Intentional Do-ocracy**, detailed in Section 2. This framework empowers members by balancing freedom with a mindful process: from an initial **Dream**, through **Design** and **Action**, to a final **Reflection** on the outcome.

For actions that are irreversible or commit significant resources, a **Formal Proposal** is required (Section 3). This is our safety mechanism: a consent-based process where members can raise formal objections.

Two areas require special care: interpersonal conflict and the safeguarding of core assets. Section 4 introduces the **Stewards**, who act as impartial counselors and guardians. They hold the ultimate authority to veto a Formal Proposal if it violates our core principles, but otherwise have no power to direct the community.

Section 5 clarifies who has a voice in our governance, distinguishing between passive **Supporters** and active **Members**, whose governance rights are earned through contribution.

To formally support the initiatives that emerge from our community, Section 6 introduces **Recognized Ecosystem Projects**, defining a clear path for them to gain official endorsement and access shared resources.

To sustain our active contributors, Section 7 outlines our system of **Contributor Rewards**. This peer-based, reputation-weighted process is how we retroactively thank Members for their valuable work.

To ensure all these interactions are smooth and constructive, we have a set of **Guidelines** (Section 8). These are not rigid rules, but a shared cultural understanding of effective and respectful behavior.

Finally, because the spirit of a rule is as important as its letter, we provide **The Legacy** (Section 9). This is the collection of articles, discussions, and philosophies that informed this Constitution, serving as the "cipher" to interpret our principles.
