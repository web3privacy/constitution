## How to Contribute

This is a living document, and we welcome community input. Because this text is our foundational agreement, changes must follow a structured and transparent process.

1. **Start a Discussion**: Before making any changes, please begin a discussion on our **[dedicated community forum](link-to-forum)**. This is the place to socialize your idea, gather initial feedback, and ensure it aligns with the community's goals.

2. **Open a Pull Request**: Once the idea is well-defined, open a **[Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/web3privacy/constitution/pulls)** in this repository. The PR must contain the specific, line-by-line changes to the relevant `.md` file(s). This PR serves as the clear technical specification for your proposed amendment.

3. **Make a Formal Proposal**: With the forum discussion and the Pull Request ready, create a **Formal Proposal** following the process in Section 3 of the Constitution. Your proposal **must** link to both the forum discussion (for context) and the Pull Request (for the specific changes). The PR will only be merged once the Formal Proposal has been successfully passed by the community.
