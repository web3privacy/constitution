# We are an Ecosystem for Impact

Web3Privacy Now is the hub where education, connection, and innovation converge to advance digital privacy. We are a community-driven organization that translates complex research into engaging content, connects builders with collaborators, and provides a powerful network for aligned projects.

We exist to build a flywheel of progress. By fostering a transparent and collaborative environment, we create a self-reinforcing cycle: education inspires new builders, connections create stronger projects, and our collective support accelerates their journey. We provide the fertile ground where ambitious ideas are nurtured, tested, and scaled.

## A Resilient Foundation

A core belief of Web3Privacy Now is that deliberate structure is not an enemy of freedom, but its necessary guardian. We recognize that "structurelessness" is a myth that inevitably conceals informal, unaccountable power structures. For a decentralized community to thrive, it must be consciously engineered to withstand conflict and stagnation. Hope and goodwill are starting points, not a complete strategy.

Our governance model is therefore built upon three fundamental acknowledgements—truths derived from observing the successes and failures of countless self-governing organizations:

* **"Common sense" is not common.** Principles must be made explicit, as our members come from diverse cultures and hold different assumptions.
* **Consensus is not always possible.** Passionate people will have conflicting goals. We need a clear and predictable process for making decisions when full agreement cannot be reached.
* **Inaction is the greatest risk.** An imperfect but clear process for solving problems is infinitely better than allowing them to fester unresolved.

This philosophy stems from the principle of Do-ocracy, evolved into what we call Intentional Do-ocracy—our framework for turning ideas into effective action.

The goal of this Constitution is to empower our community by making the "rules of the game" transparent and accessible to everyone. It is a system designed to stimulate collaboration and creative problem-solving, and you can [download the latest version as a PDF](https://web3privacy.github.io/constitution/w3pn-constitution.pdf) or [ePub](https://web3privacy.github.io/constitution/w3pn-constitution.epub). It is, by design, a work in progress. That is why [this Constitution is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/web3privacy/constitution), enabling our community to continuously refine it and for other organizations to learn from our journey.

> We, the members of Web3Privacy Now, establish this Constitution as a shared map for navigating our journey with purpose, principle, and passion.

# 1. Overview

The core operating system of Web3Privacy Now is our unique model called **Intentional Do-ocracy**, detailed in Section 2. This framework empowers members by balancing freedom with a mindful process: from an initial **Dream**, through **Design** and **Action**, to a final **Reflection** on the outcome.

For actions that are irreversible or commit significant resources, a **Formal Proposal** is required (Section 3). This is our safety mechanism: a consent-based process where members can raise formal objections.

Two areas require special care: interpersonal conflict and the safeguarding of core assets. Section 4 introduces the **Stewards**, who act as impartial counselors and guardians. They hold the ultimate authority to veto a Formal Proposal if it violates our core principles, but otherwise have no power to direct the community.

Section 5 clarifies who has a voice in our governance, distinguishing between passive **Supporters** and active **Members**, whose governance rights are earned through contribution.

To formally support the initiatives that emerge from our community, Section 6 introduces **Recognized Ecosystem Projects**, defining a clear path for them to gain official endorsement and access shared resources.

To sustain our active contributors, Section 7 outlines our system of **Contributor Rewards**. This peer-based, reputation-weighted process is how we retroactively thank Members for their valuable work.

To ensure all these interactions are smooth and constructive, we have a set of **Guidelines** (Section 8). These are not rigid rules, but a shared cultural understanding of effective and respectful behavior.

Finally, because the spirit of a rule is as important as its letter, we provide **The Legacy** (Section 9). This is the collection of articles, discussions, and philosophies that informed this Constitution, serving as the "cipher" to interpret our principles.
