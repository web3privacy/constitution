# 3. Formal Proposals & The Veto Process

This section defines the safety mechanism for irreversible or high-stakes decisions. **This is NOT a democratic voting system.** It is a consent-based process designed to ensure community alignment and prevent harm, without slowing down our core principle of Intentional Do-ocracy.

The default assumption is that a well-reasoned proposal should proceed. This process exists as a powerful "emergency brake," not as a bureaucratic hurdle.

## When is a Formal Proposal Needed?

You should initiate a Formal Proposal for actions that involve:

* **Committing significant community resources:** This includes spending funds from the main W3PN treasury.
* **Making fundamental changes to core assets:** Altering the W3PN brand, name, or primary mission.
* **Adopting official, long-term partnerships** with other organizations.
* **Amending this Constitution.**
* **Electing or removing Stewards.**

## The "Lazy Consensus" Process

> Silence equals consent.

1.  **Discussion Phase:** The initiator socializes the idea in community channels, gathers feedback, and refines their plan. This aligns with the "Design" stage of Intentional Do-ocracy.

2.  **Formal Proposal:** The initiator posts a clear proposal in a designated forum or channel. The proposal states: "I propose [ACTION], because of [REASON]. If there are no formal objections within 72 hours, this proposal will be considered approved."

3.  **Review Period (72 Hours):** The community has a 72-hour window to review the proposal.
  * **If there are no objections:** The proposal automatically passes. **Silence equals consent.** The initiator is empowered to Act.
  * **If there is an objection:** The process moves to the next stage.

## The Steward Flag: Forcing Extended Consideration

For proposals that are particularly complex, contentious, or submitted at a time that may limit community review (e.g., during a major holiday), a Steward may force an extended review period. This is not a veto, but a procedural tool to ensure sufficient time for community consideration.

1. **How to Invoke**: During the initial 72-hour review period, any single Steward may post a formal declaration in the proposal thread, such as: "Steward Flag: This proposal warrants a longer discussion. The review period is hereby extended to 7 days."
2. **The Effect**: The review period is immediately reset and extended to a total of 7 days from the time the flag was raised. The original 72-hour clock becomes void.
3. **Limitation**: A flag can only be used once per proposal. Its purpose is to extend time for discussion, not to indefinitely block a proposal. After the extended period, the proposal proceeds as normal.

## The Objection and Veto Path

An objection is not a "downvote." It is a formal declaration that you believe the proposal will cause significant harm to the organization or contradict its core principles.

1.  **How to Object:** A member must formally state their objection in the proposal thread. An objection **must include a reason**. "I don't like it" is not a valid objection. "I object because this violates our principle of X" or "I object because this will create Y unacceptable risk" are valid objections.

2.  **Resolution Dialogue:** A formal objection triggers a dialogue. The initiator and the objector(s) are expected to discuss the concerns and attempt to find a compromise that resolves the objection.

3.  **Escalation to Stewards:** If a compromise cannot be reached, either party can escalate the issue to the **Stewards**.

4.  **The Stewards' Veto:** The Stewards' role is not to decide if they *like* the proposal. Their sole function is to act as guardians of the Constitution. They will review the proposal and the objection and make one of two rulings:
  * **Veto Upheld:** The Stewards agree that the proposal causes harm or violates the community's principles. The proposal is formally **vetoed** and cannot proceed. This decision is final.
  * **Veto Overruled:** The Stewards find that the objection, while perhaps well-intentioned, does not relate to a core principle or a significant harm. They overrule the objection, and the proposal is **approved** to proceed.

This high bar ensures that the Stewards act as judges of principle, not as a typical board voting on strategy.

## Why This Model?

This "Lazy Consensus" and veto model is superior to democratic voting for our context because:

* **It is efficient.** It defaults to action and requires zero effort if a proposal is sound and well-socialized.
* **It empowers doers.** It removes the need to lobby for "yes" votes and instead focuses on ensuring no critical harm is done.
* **It avoids bikeshedding.** It elevates objections from matters of taste to matters of principle, filtering out low-stakes disagreements.

## The General Assembly & Legal Entity

If and when Web3Privacy Now operates under a formal legal structure (such as a foundation, association, or other entity), that entity will have its own legally-binding statutes. These statutes will govern specific formal procedures, such as the election of a board or the submission of annual reports. The processes in those official statutes will take precedence for any legally-required functions. This Constitution serves as our *cultural and operational* guide for everything else.
