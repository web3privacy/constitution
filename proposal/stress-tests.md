Here are **10+ stress-test scenarios** to rigorously test your governance system’s resilience, inspired by real-world failures in DAOs, cooperatives, and decentralized networks. Each is designed to expose weaknesses while keeping the exercise engaging (and even fun).

### **1. The Rogue Steward**  
**Scenario:**  
A Steward goes rogue:  
-  Starts approving malicious proposals.  
-  Blocks all objections.  
-  Claims they’re "acting for the greater good."  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Can the community **override a corrupted Steward** without a hard fork?  
-  How quickly can **emergency measures** activate?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Assign a player to play the "rogue" role. Others must stop them using constitutional tools.  

---

### **2. The Treasury Heist**  
**Scenario:**  
A proposal slips through that drains 90% of funds to an unknown wallet.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Can the community **freeze funds mid-transaction**?  
-  Does the **veto auction** work at scale?  
-  Can you **recover** without a fork?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Simulate the transaction—give players 1 hour to react.  

---

### **3. The Botnet Attack**  
**Scenario:**  
A Sybil attacker floods the system:  
-  100 fake members **spam proposals**.  
-  50 fake "objections" block all progress.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Does **reputation weighting** prevent this?  
-  Can you **detect and purge** bots fast?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Use a script to simulate spam. Players must adjust parameters (e.g., raise XP costs).  

---

### **4. The Ideological Split**  
**Scenario:**  
Two factions emerge:  
-  Group A wants **more decentralization**.  
-  Group B wants **more efficiency**.  
-  Each has 40% support—**deadlock ensues**.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Does **default to fork** work smoothly?  
-  Can **mediators** resolve it without a split?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Split players into factions. Award points for compromise.  

---

### **5. The Silent Crisis**  
**Scenario:**  
-  70% of members **go inactive** (simulating bear market apathy).  
-  Only 3 people keep submitting proposals.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Does **auto-sunset** clear stale projects?  
-  Can **incentives revive participation**?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Freeze 70% of players’ accounts. Can the rest keep things running?  

---

### **6. The Legal Onslaught**  
**Scenario:**  
A government agency declares your token a security and **demands member KYC**.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Can you **quickly vote on compliance**?  
-  Does the **constitution handle legal threats**?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Assign a "regulator" role to pressure players.  

---

### **7. The Whale Takeover**  
**Scenario:**  
A wealthy outsider buys up **60% of reputation tokens** (or delegates them).  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Do **anti-sybil rules** prevent this?  
-  Can **reputation decay** mitigate it?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Give one player 60% control. Others must adapt.  

---

### **8. The Infrastructure Collapse**  
**Scenario:**  
Your primary communication tool (Discord, forum, etc.) **gets hacked/deleted**.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Can you **rebuild using decentralized tools** (e.g., IPFS, Matrix)?  
-  Is there a **backup governance process**?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Shut down your main chat mid-test.  

---

### **9. The Counter-Constitution**  
**Scenario:**  
A faction publishes a **"better" constitution** and demands a vote.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Does your system **handle competing visions**?  
-  Can you **avoid a chain split**?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Have a subgroup draft a rival doc. Negotiate a merge.  

---

### **10. The Infinite Loop Bug**  
**Scenario:**  
A proposal passes that **accidentally creates a voting paradox** (e.g., "All future proposals need 110% approval").  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Can you **patch governance** without full reset?  
-  Does **emergency debugging** work?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Introduce a logic flaw. Watch players debug it.  

---

### **11. The Social Engineering Attack**  
**Scenario:**  
An "admin" messages members, **posing as a Steward**, and tricks them into signing malicious transactions.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Are **multi-signature safeguards** in place?  
-  How fast does the community **detect and warn others**?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Have a player impersonate staff. Measure response time.  

---

### **12. The Time Warp**  
**Scenario:**  
A bug **speeds up governance clocks**—proposals expire in 1 minute, objections in 10 seconds.  

**Test Goals:**  
-  Can the system **pause or adjust** dynamically?  
-  Do **backup timekeepers** exist?  

**Game Mechanic:**  
-  Accelerate all timers 100x.  

---

### **How to Run These Tests**  
1. **Pick 1-2 scenarios per quarter.**  
2. **Assign roles** (attackers, defenders, neutrals).  
3. **Debrief afterward**: What broke? What saved you?  
4. **Amend the constitution** to fix gaps.
