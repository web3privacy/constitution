# The Transformation Plan: Moving to a Constitutional W3PN

This document outlines a practical roadmap to evolve W3PN from an informal, founder-driven project into a resilient, community-owned ecosystem.

Every successful project eventually reaches a stage where its growth and complexity surpass what a small group of individuals can sustainably manage. This is a sign of success. The purpose of this transformation is to install a durable operating system—the Constitution—that allows W3PN to scale effectively. It aims to reduce the burden on any single person, eliminate bottlenecks, and empower the entire community to build together.

This plan is not about erasing the past, but about building a stronger foundation for the future.

## Phase 1: Laying the Foundation (The First Month)

1. **Ratify the Constitution:** The document is presented to the entire community for a final 7-day review period. If no blocking objections are raised, it is considered ratified by community consensus.
2. **Elect the Inaugural Stewards:** The community will hold an open election for the first three Stewards. Voters should carefully consider the responsibilities in **Section 4 of the Constitution**, electing candidates who demonstrate the impartiality and temperament required for this role.
3. **Execute the Asset Transition Plan:** Current administrators will work with the newly elected Stewards to execute the detailed plan for securing all organizational assets as outlined in **Appendix A**.

## Phase 2: Activating the Community (Months 2-3)

4. **Open All Communication:** All private "core team" channels are officially archived. All work-related discussions must now happen in public community channels.
5. **Bootstrap Membership:** A "Genesis Membership" period is announced. Anyone who has contributed can publicly nominate themselves. This initial group is confirmed by lazy consensus.
6. **Launch the First Rewards Epoch:** The Stewards officially announce the funding and timeline for the first **Retroactive Contributor Rewards** epoch.

## Phase 3: Living the Constitution (Ongoing)

7. **Operate Under the New Model:** All members will operate under the principles of **Intentional Do-ocracy** and **Formal Proposals** as defined in the Constitution.

## Appendix A: Asset Transition and Transparency Plan

This appendix provides a concrete, step-by-step checklist for the newly elected Stewards to follow to ensure all of W3PN's assets are secured and made transparent to the community.

### 1. Financial Assets (Treasury)

The goal is to consolidate all funds into transparent, community-controlled accounts.

* **Action 1: Create a Public Treasury Report.**
    * The first task is to create a comprehensive, public spreadsheet listing all known financial assets.
    * This report must include:
        * Crypto funds held in any wallets.
        * Fiat funds held in any bank accounts.
        * Funds held in custody by partners or sponsors.
        * A list of all outstanding invoices (money owed *to* W3PN).
        * A list of all financial commitments (money W3PN owes).

* **Action 2: Secure Crypto Assets.**
    * A new multi-signature wallet (e.g., a Gnosis Safe) will be created.
    * The three elected Stewards will be the required signers on this multi-sig wallet.
    * All crypto funds from single-signature wallets must be transferred to this new, secure multi-sig.

* **Action 3: Manage Fiat & Bank Accounts.**
    * The Stewards will become the designated signatories on any existing bank accounts.
    * The long-term goal is to attach these accounts to a formal legal entity (like a foundation or association) that is governed by the principles of this constitution.

### 2. Digital Infrastructure Assets

The goal is to eliminate single points of failure for critical infrastructure.

* **Action 1: Inventory All Digital Assets.**
    * Create a list of all core digital infrastructure, including:
        * Domain names (`web3privacy.info`, etc.)
        * Primary social media accounts (Twitter, etc.)
        * Code repositories (GitHub organization)
        * Email services / mailing lists.

* **Action 2: Secure Domain Names.**
    * Administrative control for all domains must be consolidated under a single, secure registrar account.
    * The listed owners/administrative contacts for the domains should be updated to include all three Stewards to ensure redundancy.

* **Action 3: Secure Service Accounts.**
    * A shared password manager (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password for Teams) will be established.
    * The passwords and 2FA recovery codes for all social media and service accounts will be stored in this shared vault.
    * Access to this vault will be granted to the three Stewards.

* **Action 4: Secure the GitHub Organization.**
    * The three Stewards must be granted "Owner" status of the GitHub organization to manage permissions and billing, ensuring no single person can lock others out.

### 3. Existing Commitments (Internal & External)

The goal is to honor our commitments while ensuring they are transparent.

* **Action 1: Publicly Ratify Ongoing Internal Projects.**
    * Leads of ongoing projects approved under the old system will submit a "Legacy Project Proposal." This is a public declaration of the project's goals, budget, and timeline. It will be ratified by the community via Lazy Consensus to ensure awareness.

* **Action 2: Create a Public Ledger of External Commitments.**
    * A public document will be created listing all promises made to external partners (sponsorships, collaborations, etc.).
    * The Stewards will review this ledger and ensure the community fulfills these obligations in good faith. If a conflict with the constitution arises, the Stewards will negotiate a new solution with the partner.
