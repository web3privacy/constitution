# The Transformation Plan: Moving to a Constitutional W3PN

Adopting this constitution is not a single event but a deliberate process. It requires a clear plan to transfer responsibility from the current informal structure to the transparent, community-owned model. This is a proposed roadmap to make that transition smooth, fair, and effective.

## Phase 1: Laying the Foundation (The First Month)

This phase is about formally adopting the rules and establishing the key roles needed to execute them.

1. *Ratify the Constitution:** The document is presented to the entire community for a final 7-day review period. If no blocking objections are raised, it is considered ratified by community consensus. This is the last major decision made under the old, informal system.
2. *Elect the Inaugural Stewards:** Immediately after ratification, a call for nominations for the three Steward positions is opened. Candidates will present themselves, and the community will elect the first Stewards using the Formal Proposal process defined in Section 4. This is the first official act under the new constitution.
3. *Secure and Transfer Core Assets:** Current administrators of W3PN's assets (treasury funds, domains, primary social media accounts) will transfer administrative control to the newly elected Stewards. The Stewards then hold these assets in trust for the community, with their powers strictly limited by the constitution.

## Phase 2: Activating the Community (Months 2-3)

This phase focuses on migrating from closed practices to the new, open standards.

4. *Open All Communication:** All private "core team" channels are officially archived. All work-related discussions must now happen in public community channels as mandated by the Communication Guidelines (Section 7). This makes transparency an immediate, practical reality.
5. *Bootstrap Membership:** To create the initial body of voting members, a "Genesis Membership" period is announced. Anyone who has contributed to W3PN can publicly nominate themselves, outlining how they meet the contribution criteria in Section 5. This initial group of Members is confirmed by lazy consensus. From this point on, all new members are nominated by existing ones as per the rules.
6. *Launch the First Rewards Epoch:** The Stewards officially announce the funding pool and timeline for the first **Retroactive Contributor Rewards** epoch (Section 6). This demonstrates a firm commitment to the new model and begins the cycle of fair, community-driven rewards.

## Phase 3: Living the Constitution (Ongoing)

With the foundation and processes in place, the final step is for the community to actively embrace the new system.

7. *Operate Under the New Model:**
    * *For new initiatives:** Members are empowered to use the "Intentional Do-ocracy" cycle. They can start projects without asking for permission.
    * *For spending or major changes:** Members must use the **Formal Proposal** process, ensuring community oversight.
    * *For building:** The focus shifts from a central team producing events to an ecosystem where the community is empowered to build, organize, and create, with support from the shared treasury.

## Handling Existing Projects and Commitments

A change in governance does not mean stopping all current work. W3PN must transition responsibly, honoring commitments made to both internal contributors and external partners. The goal is not to disrupt but to bring all activities into alignment with the new principles of transparency and community oversight.

### 1. For Ongoing Internal Projects

Projects that were approved under the old leadership and are currently in progress will be "grandfathered" into the new system through a process of public ratification.

* *Action Required:** The lead(s) of each ongoing project will be required to submit a **"Legacy Project Proposal"** to the community.
* *Content of the Proposal:** This document will not ask for new permission but will serve as a public declaration. It must clearly state:
    * The project's original goals.
    * The budget and resources already committed by the previous leadership.
    * The expected timeline for completion.
    * The key people involved.
* *Community Review:** This proposal will be subject to the same 72-hour "Lazy Consensus" period as any other Formal Proposal. The goal is **transparency and awareness**, not re-litigation. An objection should only be raised if the project fundamentally violates the core principles of the new constitution (e.g., privacy violations), not simply because a member dislikes the project.
* *Outcome:** Once ratified, the project is formally recognized under the new system and can proceed to completion.

### 2. For Commitments to External Partners

W3PN's reputation depends on honoring its word. Promises made to external partners by the current leadership must be upheld, but they must also be made transparent to the community.

* *Action Required:** A public ledger of all outstanding commitments to external partners must be created and shared with the community. This includes sponsorships, collaborations, and any other promised deliverables.
* *Steward-Led Review:** The newly elected Stewards will be responsible for reviewing this ledger to understand the full scope of W3PN's obligations.
* *Execution in Good Faith:** The community, led by the relevant project owners, will work to fulfill these commitments.
* *Handling Conflicts:** If a pre-existing commitment is found to be in direct conflict with the constitution's core principles, the Stewards will be responsible for contacting the partner, explaining the new governance model, and working **in good faith** to find an alternative solution that is acceptable to both parties. The goal is to maintain trust and act as a responsible organization.
