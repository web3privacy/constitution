# W3PN Governance: Frequently Asked Questions

The W3PN Constitution creates a new operating system for our community. This FAQ is designed to show how this system works in practice through real-world examples.

---

### **Q1: I have a small idea I want to execute, like creating a design for a T-shirt or writing a short research summary. Who do I ask for permission?**

**Answer: No one. You have the permission.**

This is the core of **Intentional Do-ocracy (Sec 2)**. The power to act is now decentralized.

*   **The Scenario:** You notice our research papers are dense and think a one-page, beautifully designed "TL;DR" infographic for each would be great for social media.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Dream & Design:** You have the idea and sketch out a design.
    2.  **Act:** You create the infographic for the latest paper. You use the official W3PN logos and colors.
    3.  **Reflect:** You post the finished infographic in a relevant channel on the W3PN Commons, saying, "Hey everyone, I thought it would be useful to have summary infographics for our research. Here's one for the latest paper. What do you think?"

That's it. You didn't need to ask for permission. By doing the work thoughtfully and sharing it publicly, you contributed. Now, others can build on your work, give feedback, or be inspired to do the same for other papers. In the old system, this idea might have died waiting for approval from a vague "core team." In the new system, your initiative is the only approval you need.

### **Q2: I have a big idea that needs money. How do I get funding for a W3PN-branded event in my city?**

**Answer: You write a Formal Proposal. The process is transparent and the same for everyone.**

This is where the system ensures fairness and accountability for shared resources.

*   **The Scenario:** You want to organize a "W3PN Privacy Meetup" in Berlin. You calculate you need 500 € for the venue, snacks, and drinks.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Socialize the Idea:** You first post your idea in a public channel on the **W3PN Commons** to gather feedback and see if others want to help.
    2.  **Write the Proposal:** After refining the plan, you go to the `#proposals` stream in the Commons and post a **Formal Proposal (Sec 3)**. It looks like this:
        > **Title:** Funding for W3PN Privacy Meetup - Berlin
        >
        > **I propose:** To organize a W3PN-branded meetup in Berlin on October 15th.
        > **Reason:** To grow our local community and discuss the latest privacy research.
        > **Request:** I request 500 € from the treasury to cover the attached budget (venue, food, drinks).
        >
        > If there are no formal objections within 72 hours, this proposal will be considered approved.
    3.  **Lazy Consensus:** The 72-hour review period starts. Other members can ask questions or suggest improvements. If no one formally objects, the proposal passes automatically.
    4.  **Execution by Stewards:** Once passed, you notify the **Stewards (Sec 4)**. They see the approved proposal and, using the **2-of-3 multisig wallet**, send the 500 € to the account you specified.

The key difference is that the decision was made in public based on the merit of the proposal, not on who you know. The rules for accessing the treasury are identical for all Members.

### **Q3: A proposal has been made that I think is dangerous and violates our principles. How do I stop it?**

**Answer: You file a Formal Objection. This forces a dialogue and, if necessary, a ruling by the Stewards.**

This is the system's emergency brake, designed to protect our core values.

*   **The Scenario:** A Member proposes a formal partnership with "MegaCorp Analytics," a large, well-funded company with a questionable history on data privacy. The proposal argues their funding could accelerate our work.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **You Object:** During the 72-hour review period, you post in the `#proposals` stream:
        > "I **formally object** to this proposal. Our constitution's preamble is about advancing digital privacy. Partnering with a company known for data harvesting directly violates this core principle."
    2.  **Dialogue:** Your objection halts the "lazy consensus" clock. The proposal cannot pass. You, the proposer, and other members must now discuss the issue. Perhaps a compromise can be found (e.g., the money is accepted but with extremely strict public conditions).
    3.  **Escalation to Stewards:** If no agreement can be reached, the issue is escalated to the **Stewards**.
    4.  **The Steward Ruling (Veto):** The Stewards' job is *not* to decide if they personally like the deal. Their only job is to judge if it violates the Constitution. They would review your objection and the proposal and could rule: "Veto Upheld. The objection is valid as the partnership conflicts with the foundational principles of W3PN." The proposal is now dead.

This process prevents a single person from stopping a proposal out of personal taste, but empowers anyone to protect the community's integrity by invoking its own foundational rules.

### **Q4: I've been contributing a ton of my time for months, but I'm not a "developer" or a "researcher." How does the system recognize my work?**

**Answer: Through Retroactive Contributor Rewards, where your peers reward your value.**

This system is designed to recognize *all* forms of valuable contribution, especially work like community management, organization, and translation that is often invisible.

*   **The Scenario:** For the last three months, you have been tirelessly organizing community calls, onboarding new members, and translating articles.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **The Epoch Ends:** A Funding Epoch concludes, and the **Retroactive Contributor Rewards (Sec 6)** process begins.
    2.  **Peer Allocation:** Every Member gets 100 points to allocate. A core researcher you helped onboard gives you 30 points, writing, "For being incredibly helpful and making my first month here productive." A developer gives you 20 points: "For organizing the community calls that helped us sync up."
    3.  **Weighted Calculation:** The system calculates the final scores. Since the people who gave you points are themselves highly-valued contributors, their allocations carry more weight. Your final score is high.
    4.  **Reward:** You receive a share of the rewards pool proportional to your final score, directly acknowledging the value your peers saw in your work.

This system bypasses central bosses or committees. Your reward is a direct reflection of the reputation and value you have built within the community itself.

### **Q5: A new person just showed up and is awesome. How do they become a Member with voting rights?**

**Answer: Through demonstrating their value and being nominated by a peer.**

The path to influence is transparent and based on merit, not cronyism.

*   **The Scenario:** A new person, "Leo," joins the community. He starts by making helpful comments on a research draft. He then volunteers to take over the management of the W3PN Twitter account for a month (**Intentional Do-ocracy**). He does a fantastic job, increasing engagement and being highly professional.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Demonstrated Contribution:** Leo has created a clear, public track record of valuable work over several weeks.
    2.  **Public Nomination:** An existing Member is impressed. They go to the **W3PN Commons** and post: "I nominate Leo for Membership. Over the last month, he has proven to be a reliable and valuable contributor by revitalizing our social media presence (link to examples)."
    3.  **Community Consent:** The nomination is open for 72 hours. Since everyone has seen Leo's great work, there are no objections.
    4.  **Steward Confirmation:** After the period passes, the **Stewards** perform the final administrative act of granting Leo the "Member" role and welcoming him to the governance process.

Leo's path was clear, open, and based entirely on his contributions. He earned his seat at the table.

### **Q6: A Steward strongly disagrees with a project a Member has started. Can they use their authority to shut it down?**

**Answer: No. A Steward's authority is for guardianship and process, not for dictating strategy.**

This is a critical test of the **limits of Steward power (Sec 4)**. Stewards are not bosses.

*   **The Scenario:** A Member starts a project under Intentional Do-ocracy to create a series of edgy, controversial memes to promote privacy, believing it will reach a new audience. One of the Stewards finds the memes unprofessional and fears they will damage the W3PN brand.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Stewards Act as Members:** The Steward cannot simply order the project to stop. To voice their opposition, they must act as a regular **Member**. They can post their concerns in the project's channel, arguing their case based on its merits.
    2.  **No Special Veto Power:** The Steward's veto power only applies to **Formal Proposals** that have received a formal objection and are escalated to them. They cannot unilaterally veto a member's independent project.
    3.  **The Only Path to Stop It:** If the Steward believes the project causes *significant harm* and violates a core principle, their only path is the same as any other member: make a **Formal Proposal** to the entire community to officially adopt a guideline that would prevent such memes. The community would then decide via lazy consensus.

This shows that power is vested in the process, not the position. The Steward's opinion carries the weight of their reputation, not the weight of their title.

### **Q7: Two influential Members are in a public, personal conflict, and it's making everyone uncomfortable. How is this resolved?**

**Answer: It is escalated to the Stewards, who act as impartial mediators, not judges.**

The Constitution provides a path for de-escalation that focuses on restoring health, not assigning blame.

*   **The Scenario:** Two long-time contributors, Alice and Bob, have a sharp disagreement over project strategy that spills over into personal attacks in a public channel. The tension is halting progress and forcing other members to take sides.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Direct Resolution Fails:** Other members encourage them to resolve it directly (**Guidelines, Sec 7**), but they refuse.
    2.  **Escalation:** Any Member who feels the conflict is harming the community can formally escalate the issue to the **Stewards (Sec 4)**.
    3.  **Mediation, Not Punishment:** The Stewards' role is to act as **impartial counselors**. They will invite Alice and Bob to a private, mediated conversation. Their goal is not to decide who was "right," but to facilitate a dialogue where both parties can be heard and a path to constructive collaboration can be found.
    4.  **Focus on Community Health:** The outcome might be a public apology, an agreement on communication norms, or a decision for them to work on separate projects for a while. The solution is whatever best allows the community to move forward in a healthy way.

### **Q8: An important Formal Proposal is posted, but a Member who has been inactive for a year shows up and objects. Is their objection valid?**

**Answer: Yes, their objection is valid according to the rules, but subject to community scrutiny.**

This tests the principle that **Membership is not lost due to dormancy (Sec 5)**.

*   **The Scenario:** A well-discussed proposal to fund a new research wing is posted. Just before the 72-hour period ends, a Member who hasn't been seen in over a year posts, "I formally object. I don't like this direction."
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **The Rule is Upheld:** According to the Constitution, they are still a Member and their objection is procedurally valid. The proposal is halted.
    2.  **The Social Layer Kicks In:** This is where the community's social norms become crucial. The proposer and other active Members have every right to publicly and respectfully ask for clarification: "Welcome back! Can you provide more context for your objection? What specific harm do you believe this will cause? We have been discussing this for weeks, and the background can be found here (link)."
    3.  **The Burden of Justification:** The burden is now on the objector to provide a substantive reason. An objection without a coherent argument based on the community's principles or well-being will likely fail to gain traction and, if escalated, would almost certainly be overruled by the Stewards.

This shows that while rights are protected, influence and credibility must be earned and maintained through active, good-faith participation.

### **Q9: I suspect two Members are "log-rolling" in the Retroactive Contributor Rewards system by just giving all their points to each other. Can the system be gamed?**

**Answer: The system is designed with transparency to make this behavior obvious and ineffective.**

The **Reputation-Weighted Model (Sec 6)** and public justifications are the defense against this.

*   **The Scenario:** At the end of an epoch, you notice that Members Charlie and Dana have each given 100 points to the other.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Public Justifications:** The first check is the mandatory public justification. If their justifications are weak ("'cause Dana is great"), it will be immediately apparent to all other Members that this isn't based on a serious evaluation of work.
    2.  **The Reputation Weighting:** The system's key feature kicks in. Let's say Charlie and Dana only contributed a little during the epoch. Other active Members likely gave them very few points. This means their own "Raw Scores" are low.
    3.  **Low Impact:** Because their Raw Scores are low, the "Allocator Weight" of their vote is also very low. When Charlie gives 100 points to Dana, those points are multiplied by Charlie's low weight, resulting in a small final score for Dana. Their mutual back-scratching has minimal impact on the final distribution because the system is designed to amplify the opinions of those who the *entire community* recognizes as valuable contributors.

### **Q10: The W3PN website is down because the domain bill is overdue! Do we have to wait 72 hours for a Formal Proposal to pay it?**

**Answer: No. This calls for responsible emergency action, immediately followed by the formal process.**

The spirit of the Constitution is to enable action, not paralyze it with bureaucracy.

*   **The Scenario:** It's a Saturday and the `web3privacy.info` domain has expired. The site is offline.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Emergency Action:** Any one of the three **Stewards** sees the issue. They immediately pay the $20 renewal fee out of their own pocket to get the site back online as quickly as possible.
    2.  **Immediate Public Justification:** The Steward who paid then goes directly to the `#proposals` stream and posts a **reimbursement proposal**:
        > **Title:** Emergency Reimbursement for Domain Renewal
        > **I propose:** To be reimbursed $20 from the treasury.
        > **Reason:** The `web3privacy.info` domain expired today at 14:00 UTC, taking the site offline. I paid the bill out-of-pocket to resolve the emergency. Receipt is attached.
    3.  **Retroactive Approval:** The community will obviously approve this. This action builds immense trust. It shows the Stewards are responsible caretakers who can act decisively in an emergency but remain fully accountable to the transparent public process for the use of funds.

### **Q11: How exactly does the Fiat Custodian spend money for something like a venue deposit?**

**Answer: They act as a trusted agent, executing a decision made by the community, with full transparency.**

This clarifies the practical workflow for the **Fiat Custodian** role established in the transformation plan.

*   **The Scenario:** A Formal Proposal to rent a workshop space for 200€ has passed. The venue needs the funds via a bank transfer.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Proposal is the Authorization:** The approved proposal in the `#proposals` stream is the Steward's official authorization to act.
    2.  **Custodian Executes:** The designated Fiat Custodian makes the 200€ bank transfer from the account where they hold W3PN's fiat funds.
    3.  **Provide Proof:** The custodian then posts a redacted screenshot of the transfer confirmation or receipt in a dedicated "Finances" channel on the Commons.
    4.  **Ledger is Updated:** In their next scheduled report, the custodian includes this 200€ transaction in the public ledger of expenses, ensuring the community's books are always balanced and transparent.

### **Q12: I think a rule in the Constitution itself is flawed. Is it set in stone? Can we change it?**

**Answer: No, it's not set in stone. The Constitution is a living document that can be amended by the community.**

The process for changing the rules is one of the most important rules itself (**Sec 3**).

*   **The Scenario:** A Member feels the 72-hour "Lazy Consensus" window is too short for complex proposals, leading to rushed decisions. They want to propose it be changed to 5 days.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Draft an Amendment Proposal:** The Member drafts a **Formal Proposal** just like any other. However, this one is special:
        > **Title:** Constitutional Amendment: Extend Proposal Review Period
        > **I propose:** To amend Section 3 of the Constitution, changing the default review period from "72 hours" to "5 days."
        > **Reason:** 72 hours is not sufficient for our global, distributed team to provide thoughtful feedback on complex issues.
    2.  **Community Debate:** Given its importance, this proposal would likely generate significant discussion. The community might even agree to a longer, informal discussion period before the official 5-day clock starts.
    3.  **Approval:** If the proposal passes via lazy consensus, the Constitution itself is officially updated. The change is announced, and all future proposals now operate under the new 5-day rule. The community has successfully upgraded its own operating system.

### **Q13: A new person claims a past "core team" member promised them a large payment for old work, but there's no proof. How is this handled?**

**Answer: It gets added to the "Legacy Ledger" and is decided upon transparently by the current Membership.**

This process prevents old, undocumented "handshake deals" from becoming a source of conflict.

*   **The Scenario:** During the commitment audit, an individual comes forward claiming they are owed 2,000€ for design work done last year, but they have no contract or written agreement to show for it.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Document the Claim:** The Stewards add the claim to the **"Legacy Commitments Ledger"** but note it clearly: "Verbal claim, no written proof."
    2.  **Present to the Community:** The Stewards present the entire ledger, including this controversial item, in a Formal Proposal to the Members.
    3.  **Public Scrutiny:** The community now discusses this specific claim in the `#proposals` stream. Members can ask for evidence, and the person who allegedly made the promise can be asked to confirm or deny it.
    4.  **Community Decision:** The final decision rests with the Members. They might vote to honor the full amount based on testimony, reject it due to lack of proof, or propose a compromise. Whatever the outcome, the decision is made transparently by the current governing body, not in private.

### **Q14: A contributor needs access to our main Twitter account for a weekend campaign. How do we give it to them securely?**

**Answer: By using the shared password vault, which provides secure, revocable access without revealing master credentials.**

This demonstrates the practical security benefits of the asset management policy.

*   **The Scenario:** A trusted community member is running a 2-day social media campaign and needs to post from the official `@web3privacy` account.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Steward Action:** The project lead makes an informal request to the Stewards.
    2.  **Use the Vault's Features:** A Steward logs into the community's shared **password vault**. Instead of sharing the master password, they use one of two methods:
        *   They use Twitter's native "Team" feature to grant the contributor's personal account posting privileges for a limited time.
        *   They use the vault to generate a temporary, separate "app password" and share that.
    3.  **Revoke Access:** Once the campaign is over, the Steward revokes the access. The master password was never exposed, and the community's asset remains secure.

### **Q15: A Member used Do-ocracy to redesign our event banner, but the result is off-brand and contains typos. What do we do?**

**Answer: We thank them for the initiative and then gently correct the work, using it as a teaching moment.**

This is where the **"Reflect" step (Sec 2)** and **community guidelines (Sec 7)** come together to allow for blameless correction.

*   **The Scenario:** An enthusiastic Member, trying to be helpful, creates and shares a new banner for an upcoming event, but it uses the wrong font and has a glaring typo.
*   **How the Constitution Solves It:**
    1.  **Acknowledge the Initiative:** The first response in the public channel should not be criticism. It should be: "Thank you so much for taking the initiative on this! It's great to have a banner started."
    2.  **Provide Constructive Feedback:** The next step is to offer a constructive correction. "To keep everything looking consistent, I've tweaked it a bit to align with our brand guidelines and fixed a small typo. Here's the updated version. What do you think?"
    3.  **Blameless Correction:** The original banner is replaced. The contributor who made the mistake doesn't feel attacked; instead, they feel appreciated for their initiative and have now learned about the brand guidelines for next time. The community's quality standards are maintained without discouraging future contributions.
