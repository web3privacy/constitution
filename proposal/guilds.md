# W3PN Proposed Guilds (8/2025)

Our organization is structured around **Guilds**. These are our foundational, long-term teams, each focused on a specific operational function like Communications, Treasury, or Events.

Think of Guilds as our core capability centers. They house our experts and provide stable, ongoing support for all organizational activities. In contrast, specific initiatives (or "Projects") will be formed as needed, drawing the necessary people and skills from these core Guilds. This structure allows us to maintain deep expertise while flexibly tackling new goals.
