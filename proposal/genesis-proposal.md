# Genesis Proposal (draft)

*Web3Privacy Now* has been operating successfully for several years under a centralized governance model. With the ratification of our [Constitution](https://constitution.w3pn.org/), we are now transitioning to a decentralized, community-driven governance structure. 

This Genesis Proposal marks this historic transition by formally recognizing our existing active contributors as **Members** with full governance rights and transforming our informal working groups into constitutionally-recognized **Guilds**. This establishes the clear operational structures needed for our new Intentional Do-ocracy while ensuring continuity of our ongoing work.

# Part 1: Members

The following active contributors are recognized as the initial Members under our new constitutional governance, based on their sustained contributions to W3PN over recent years:

## Proposed Constitutional Members and Their Contributions

- **Coinmandeer** - Led visual identity development, created merchandise designs, actively contributed to brand evolution
- **PG** - Managed treasury operations, built partnership relationships, coordinated communications efforts
- **Tree** - Maintained critical infrastructure, organized events, ensured technical operations continuity
- **Mykola** - Conducted privacy research, coordinated communications, produced educational content
- **Peter** - Developed educational materials and programs for community learning
- **Babybit** - Created video content and documentary materials advancing our mission
- **Andreea** - Co-organized events and community gatherings

*[Note: Add any additional active contributors]*

These individuals have demonstrated sustained commitment through years of contribution and will form the initial governing body under our new constitutional structure.

# Part 2: Guilds

Our existing informal working groups are hereby formalized as the following nine constitutional Guilds:

| Guild Name | Purpose | Initial Steward(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Visuals & Merch** | Visual assets and merchandise | Coinmandeer |
| **Partnerships** | External relationships | PG |
| **Treasury** | Financial management | PG |
| **Infrastructure** | Technical operations | Tree |
| **Communications** | Internal/external messaging | Mykola, PG |
| **Research** | R&D and strategy | Mykola |
| **Education** | Learning materials and programs | Peter |
| **Video** | Video content and documentaries | Babybit |
| **Events** | Online and in-person gatherings | Tree, Andreea |

## Implementation Details

1. **Transition Process:** This proposal formalizes existing collaborative structures within the constitutional framework, ensuring continuity while enabling decentralized governance.
2. **Guild Operations:** Each Guild operates under Intentional Do-ocracy principles. Guild Stewards coordinate but do not command.
3. **Cross-Guild Collaboration:** Members may participate in multiple Guilds. Projects requiring multiple skill sets will draw from relevant Guilds.
4. **Future Evolution:** New Guilds may be created and existing ones modified through future Formal Proposals as our needs evolve.
5. **Communication Channels:** Each Guild maintains its existing dedicated channel on our commons platform.
