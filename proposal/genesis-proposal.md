# Genesis Proposal (draft)

*Web3Privacy Now* has been operating successfully for several years under a centralized governance model. With the ratification of our [Constitution](https://constitution.w3pn.org/), we are now transitioning to a decentralized, community-driven governance structure. 

This Genesis Proposal marks this historic transition by formally recognizing our existing active contributors as **Members** with full governance rights, transforming our informal working groups into constitutionally-recognized **Guilds**, and electing our first **Stewards**. This establishes the clear operational structures needed for our new Intentional Do-ocracy while ensuring continuity of our ongoing work.

## Special Bootstrap Process

This Genesis Proposal was developed and consensually approved during our in-person W3PN Offsite in Slovenia, where all proposed founding Members were present. As no constitutional Members exist yet to follow the standard Formal Proposal process, this proposal takes immediate effect upon collective agreement of all participants present at the Offsite and its publication on our public forum. The standard review period is waived for this founding act.

## Part 0: Core Commitments

By ratifying this Genesis Proposal, all founding Members commit to embracing our new constitutional governance model:

### Foundational Principles

1. **Constitutional Governance**: The Constitution becomes our primary governance framework. All major decisions affecting the community follow constitutional processes.

2. **Intentional Do-ocracy**: We embrace a model where authority comes from active contribution and taking responsibility for outcomes, not from titles or historical positions.

3. **Transparent by Default**: Community decisions, budgets, and governance activities should be public and documented. Private discussions remain appropriate for sensitive personal matters, conflict resolution, and early-stage brainstorming.

4. **Progressive Decentralization**: We commit to steadily reducing single points of control, particularly over treasury and critical infrastructure, according to the timeline in this proposal.

5. **Documented Decision-Making**: Important decisions must be recorded on our forum. Verbal agreements about community resources or direction need written documentation to be valid.

### Implementation Approach

- **Learning Together**: We recognize this is a significant transition. Members support each other in understanding and adapting to new processes
- **Grace Period**: The 30 and 90-day timelines allow for adjustment while maintaining momentum toward full implementation
- **Iterative Improvement**: We can refine processes through Formal Proposals as we learn what works best
- **Good Faith Effort**: We expect genuine commitment to the transition, even as we work through the details together

**By becoming a founding Member, you agree to work constructively toward these shared goals.**

# Part 1: Members

The following active contributors are recognized as the initial Members under our new constitutional governance, based on their sustained contributions to W3PN over recent years:

## Proposed Members and Their Contributions (8)

- **Coinmandeer** - Led visual identity development, created merchandise designs, actively contributed to brand evolution
- **PG** - Managed treasury operations, built partnership relationships, coordinated communications efforts
- **Tree** - Maintained critical infrastructure, organized events, ensured technical operations continuity
- **Mykola** - Conducted privacy research, coordinated communications, produced educational content
- **Peter** - Developed educational materials
- **Babybit** - Created video content and documentary materials advancing our mission
- **Andreea** - Co-organized events and community gatherings
- **Jensei** - Developed Privacy Builder Pack, contributed to various projects, provided valuable governance insights

*[Note: Add any additional active contributors]*

These individuals have demonstrated sustained commitment through years of contribution and will form the initial governing body under our new constitutional structure.

# Part 2: Guilds

Our existing informal working groups are hereby formalized as the following nine Guilds:

| Guild Name | Purpose | Initial Steward(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Design & Brand** | Visual identity, branding, and merch | Coinmandeer |
| **Partnerships** | External relationships | PG |
| **Treasury** | Financial management | PG |
| **Infrastructure** | Technical operations | Tree |
| **Communications** | Internal/external messaging | Mykola, PG |
| **Research** | R&D and strategy | Mykola |
| **Video** | Video content and documentaries | Babybit |
| **Events** | Online and in-person gatherings | Tree, Andreea |

## Guild Operations

- **Intentional Do-ocracy**: Each Guild operates under Intentional Do-ocracy principles. Guild Stewards coordinate but do not command.
- **Cross-Guild Collaboration**: Members may participate in multiple Guilds. Projects requiring multiple skill sets will draw from relevant Guilds.
- **Evolution**: New Guilds may be created and existing ones modified through future Formal Proposals as our needs evolve.
- **Communication**: Each Guild maintains its existing dedicated public channel on our [Commons platform](https://commons.w3pn.org/) (forum).

# Part 3: Stewards

Per Section 4 of our Constitution, three Stewards must be elected to serve as guardians of our constitutional principles and mediators in disputes. Upon ratification of this proposal, the following Members are elected as our initial Stewards:

## Elected Stewards

- **Tree** (1 year term) - Author of our Constitution, providing the deepest understanding of our constitutional principles
- **PG** (9 month term) - Current treasury custodian with deep understanding of W3PN's financial operations and existing commitments, ensuring continuity during the transition
- **Jensei** (6 month term) - Experienced in forum-based governance and community coordination, bringing practical knowledge of decentralized decision-making tools

These staggered initial terms ensure continuity of governance knowledge. After these initial terms expire, all future Steward elections will follow the standard one-year terms as specified in the Constitution, with elections occurring at different times to maintain the staggered structure.

# Part 4: Transition Roadmap

While constitutional governance begins immediately upon ratification, we acknowledge that full transition from centralized operations will require time. This roadmap establishes clear commitments and timelines:

## Immediate Changes (Effective Upon Ratification)
- Constitutional governance is active
- All NEW decisions must follow constitutional processes
- Members have full governance rights
- Stewards assume their roles
- Guilds are formally established with initial stewards
- **Terminology**: "Member" now refers to constitutional governance participants; financial donors/sponsors are now "Supporters"

## 30-Day Commitments
- **Project Legitimization**:
  - All existing project leaders must post on the forum:
    - Project description and objectives
    - Current status and progress
    - Budget allocation (if any)
    - Team members involved
    - Expected completion timeline
  - Projects without forum documentation by day 30 lose access to resources
- **Guild Activation**:
  - Each Guild steward creates basic operational documentation (purpose, scope, how to contribute)
  - Guilds identify immediate needs and skill gaps
  - Begin recruiting additional guild members from the community
- Treasury Guild will propose a treasury decentralization plan via Formal Proposal
- All existing projects and budget commitments will be documented publicly on the forum
- Infrastructure Guild will conduct forum onboarding sessions for all Members
- Add basic Constitution link and governance info to existing website

## 90-Day Targets
- **Guild Maturation**:
  - Each Guild publishes comprehensive guidelines and workflows
  - Active recruitment campaigns for needed skills
  - First inter-guild collaborative projects launched
  - Guild health metrics established (active contributors, output, etc.)
- All new budget allocations exclusively via Formal Proposals
- First Retroactive Contributor Rewards round (Q4 2025)
- Migration of all active project management to constitutional framework
- **Website & Documentation Overhaul**: Launch fully updated website and documentation reflecting:
  - Constitutional governance structure
  - Member vs Supporter distinction
  - Guild structure and responsibilities
  - How to participate and contribute
  - Complete governance processes and guides
- Review and potential first constitutional amendment if needed

## Legacy Commitments
- Existing contractual obligations and approved budgets will be honored until completion
- Any modifications to existing commitments require Formal Proposals
- All legacy decisions must be documented with clear sunset dates
