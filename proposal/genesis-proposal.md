# Genesis Proposal (draft)

*Web3Privacy Now* has been operating successfully for several years under a centralized governance model. With the ratification of our [Constitution](https://constitution.w3pn.org/), we are now transitioning to a decentralized, community-driven governance structure. 

This Genesis Proposal marks this historic transition by formally recognizing our existing active contributors as **Members** with full governance rights, transforming our informal working groups into constitutionally-recognized **Guilds**, and electing our first **Stewards**. This establishes the clear operational structures needed for our new Intentional Do-ocracy while ensuring continuity of our ongoing work.

## Special Bootstrap Process

This Genesis Proposal was developed and consensually approved during our in-person W3PN Offsite in Slovenia, where all proposed founding Members were present. As no constitutional Members exist yet to follow the standard Formal Proposal process, this proposal takes immediate effect upon collective agreement of all participants present at the Offsite and its publication on our public forum ([The Commons](https://commons.w3pn.org/)). The standard review period is waived for this founding act.

# Part 1: Members

The following active contributors are recognized as the initial Members under our new constitutional governance, based on their sustained contributions to W3PN over recent years:

## Proposed Members and Their Contributions

- **Coinmandeer** - Led visual identity development, created merchandise designs, actively contributed to brand evolution
- **PG** - Managed treasury operations, built partnership relationships, coordinated communications efforts
- **Tree** - Maintained critical infrastructure, organized events, ensured technical operations continuity
- **Mykola** - Conducted privacy research, coordinated communications, produced educational content
- **Peter** - Developed educational materials and programs for community learning
- **Babybit** - Created video content and documentary materials advancing our mission
- **Andreea** - Co-organized events and community gatherings

*[Note: Add any additional active contributors]*

These individuals have demonstrated sustained commitment through years of contribution and will form the initial governing body under our new constitutional structure.

# Part 2: Guilds

Our existing informal working groups are hereby formalized as the following nine Guilds:

| Guild Name | Purpose | Initial Steward(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Visuals & Merch** | Visual assets and merchandise | Coinmandeer |
| **Partnerships** | External relationships | PG |
| **Treasury** | Financial management | PG |
| **Infrastructure** | Technical operations | Tree |
| **Communications** | Internal/external messaging | Mykola, PG |
| **Research** | R&D and strategy | Mykola |
| **Education** | Learning materials and programs | Peter |
| **Video** | Video content and documentaries | Babybit |
| **Events** | Online and in-person gatherings | Tree, Andreea |

# Part 3: Stewards

Per Section 4 of our Constitution, three Stewards must be elected to serve as guardians of our constitutional principles and mediators in disputes. Upon ratification of this proposal, the following Members are elected as our initial Stewards:

## Elected Stewards

- **Tree** (1 year term) - Author of our Constitution and has studied governance systems for years, providing the deepest understanding of our constitutional principles
- **[Name 2]** (9 month term) - [Brief reason why they would be a good steward]  
- **[Name 3]** (6 month term) - [Brief reason why they would be a good steward]

*[Note: Names 2 and 3 to be filled in during the Offsite discussion]*

These staggered initial terms ensure continuity of governance knowledge. After these initial terms expire, all future Steward elections will follow the standard one-year terms as specified in the Constitution, with elections occurring at different times to maintain the staggered structure.

# Implementation Details

1. **Transition Process:** This proposal formalizes existing collaborative structures within the constitutional framework, ensuring continuity while enabling decentralized governance.
2. **Guild Operations:** Each Guild operates under Intentional Do-ocracy principles. Guild Stewards coordinate but do not command.
3. **Cross-Guild Collaboration:** Members may participate in multiple Guilds. Projects requiring multiple skill sets will draw from relevant Guilds.
4. **Future Evolution:** New Guilds may be created and existing ones modified through future Formal Proposals as our needs evolve.
5. **Communication Channels:** Each Guild maintains its existing dedicated public channel on our [Commons platform](https://commons.w3pn.org/) (forum).
