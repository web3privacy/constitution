# 2. Intentional Do-ocracy

## Our Framework for Effective Action

> DREAM -> DESIGN -> DECIDE -> ACT -> REFLECT -> (and back to DREAM)

Our model of Do-ocracy is built on a five-stage process that empowers effective, well-considered action. It's about owning an idea from start to finish.

*   **Dream:** You are empowered to make things happen. If you have an idea, you have the agency to take the initiative.
*   **Design:** Before you act, take time to think through the execution. For small tasks, this might take seconds. For larger projects, it might involve a sketch, a brief plan, or a chat with others.
*   **Decide:** Commit to a course of action. For most things, this is a personal decision. For major initiatives, this might involve a Formal Proposal (see Section 3) to ensure alignment.
*   **Act:** Do the thing! This is where the plan turns into reality.
*   **Reflect:** Share your work. Announce what you did, why you did it, and what the outcome was. This builds trust, shares knowledge, and helps us all learn from both successes and failures. If a member raises a concern, engage with them to find a resolution.

This is the core of **Intentional Do-ocracy**: a structure where individuals are empowered to lead projects from idea to completion, and where the act of leading the work is its own justification.

## Our Evolution: Why "Intentional"?

The classic "Just Do It!" model of Do-ocracy is a powerful antidote to the paralysis that plagues many organizations. We honor that spirit. However, experience shows that a purely reactive model can sometimes lead to a "Dream → Act" loop, where action is taken without sufficient planning or learning. This can result in wasted effort, frustration, and a failure to build collective wisdom.

We have deliberately evolved this model into what we call **Intentional Do-ocracy**. By explicitly adding the **Design** and **Reflect** stages, we aim to transform raw action into effective action.

*   The **Design** step encourages thoughtful planning *before* execution, saving time and resources.
*   The **Reflect** step ensures we learn from *every* outcome, turning individual actions into community knowledge.

This doesn't add bureaucracy; it adds mindfulness. It's how we ensure our community is not just busy, but productive, sustainable, and constantly improving.

## Why Intentional Do-ocracy?

While valuable tools, relying solely on formal democracy or consensus for every action can lead to paralysis. A purely discussion-based model can suffer from several issues:

*   It consumes significant time and energy that could be better spent building, educating, or campaigning.
*   It creates bottlenecks where important problems don't get solved because the group cannot reach a perfect agreement. This is a critical failure, because **a good solution implemented now is often better than a perfect solution debated forever.**
*   It can lead to diluted outcomes that are compromises nobody is passionate about, resulting in a lack of energy for implementation.
*   It can empower voices that contribute opinions without contributing action, slowing down those who are ready to build.
*   It encourages long feedback loops. Our work is inspired by modern development practices (like Agile) that stress the importance of short feedback loops and rapid iteration.

This is why we choose **Intentional Do-ocracy**: to empower action, while ensuring it is thoughtful and effective through our five-stage process.

## How It Thrives

A healthy Do-ocracy emerges when the environment is right. We foster this environment through our culture:

*   **Allow people to fail.** We must feel safe to try and fail. When failure happens, we treat it as a learning opportunity and help each other improve, rather than assigning blame. Our community gives everyone room to grow. (For more on this, research "blameless post-mortems" in the tech community).
*   **Ask for help and help others.**
*   **Trust each other by default.**
*   **Focus on what we have in common**, not what we disagree on.
*   **Recognize and amplify the work of those who contribute.**

## Noncoercive Authority

It is a misconception that in a Do-ocracy, nobody is in charge. The people doing the work have authority over their specific projects. However, this power is noncoercive and temporary—it is lost when they stop contributing to that effort.

> A do-ocratic example: W3PN has no formal event series. Alex posts in the community Discord, "What if we organized a 'State of Privacy' online summit?" (Dream). Others respond with ideas. Because this is too big for one person, Alex's role shifts from "doer" to "project lead." Alex's responsibility is now to coordinate, not to do everything themself. They draft a plan, outline needed roles (e.g., "Speaker Outreach," "Technical Support," "Marketing"), and invite volunteers in a new channel (Design & Decide). The team then runs the event (Act).
>
> A new member might ask, “Why does Alex get to decide the summit’s platform? Who put them in charge?” The answer is: **the Intentional Do-ocracy put them in charge.** The very act of initiating and organizing the summit grants Alex authority and *responsibility* over it. They become the steward of that idea’s entire lifecycle, which includes ensuring the team works smoothly. If they later post a summary of what went well, they complete the cycle (Reflect).

## Limitations

Some actions are too sensitive or irreversible for **Intentional Do-ocracy** alone. For these situations, refer to the sections on **Formal Proposals** (Section 3) and **Stewards** (Section 4).

In general, if an action commits significant community resources, is strategically irreversible, or affects core shared assets, it requires a Formal Proposal, not just individual action.

## An Intentional Do-ocracy Is Not a...

*   **Democracy:** In a democracy, everyone has a say in what gets done. In our system, everyone can do jobs that they think need to be done, **without requiring everyone’s input for every step.**
*   **Meritocracy:** In a meritocracy, the "most qualified" people are selected for a job. In our system, whoever does the work gets it, regardless of their formal qualifications. Skill is proven by doing.
