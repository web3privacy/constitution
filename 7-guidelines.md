# 7. Guidelines

This Constitution provides the structure for our organization, but our culture is built on the actions we take every day. These guidelines are not strict laws, but a shared understanding of how we can work together effectively and respectfully. They are the spirit that animates the letter of our rules.

## Communication

* **Assume Good Faith:** When reading a message, interpret it in the most generous way possible. If something is unclear, ask for clarification before assuming negative intent. In a global, text-based community, misunderstandings are easy; good faith is our default.
* **Critique Ideas, Not People:** We must be able to have robust debates about strategies, projects, and ideas. Focus your feedback on the work itself, not on the person who created it.
* **Public by Default:** To maximize transparency and learning, all work-related discussions should happen in public community channels. Reserve private messages for sensitive or strictly personal matters.
* **Be Clear and Explicit:** Our community is diverse. What is "common sense" to one person may be new to another. Avoid jargon where you can, explain your reasoning, and don't be afraid to state the obvious.

## Collaboration

* **Give Credit Generously:** If you build on someone's idea or use their work, give them public credit. Recognition is the primary currency in our ecosystem.
* **Amplify Others:** Our collective success depends on mutual support. When you see a fellow member doing great work, share it, promote it, and celebrate it.
* **Ask for Help, Offer Help:** No one is expected to know everything. Asking for help is a sign of strength. Offering help when you can builds the connective tissue of our community.
* **Cultivate Wholeness:** We encourage members to bring their whole selves to this workâ€”their passion, their creativity, and their intuition. We strive to create an environment of psychological safety where authentic connection and vulnerability are valued alongside technical contribution.

## Disagreement & Conflict

* **Disagree Constructively:** Disagreement is healthy and necessary for progress. When you object to something, do so respectfully and provide a clear reason. Suggest alternatives where possible.
* **Seek to Understand First:** Before you critique or object, ensure you understand the proposal. Ask clarifying questions. A simple "Can you help me understand why you chose this approach?" can resolve many conflicts before they start.
* **Direct Resolution is Preferred:** If you have an issue with another member, the first step should always be a direct and respectful conversation with them. The Stewards are a final backstop for serious conflicts, not a first resort.

## Contribution & Ownership

* **Embrace the Full Cycle:** True contribution follows our model of **Intentional Do-ocracy**. It's not just about doing the task (Act), but also about planning it (Design) and sharing the outcome (Reflect).
* **Hand Off Cleanly:** If you start a project and can no longer continue it, you are responsible for communicating its status. Either officially archive it or find another member to take ownership. Don't leave "zombie" projects that confuse other contributors.
* **Leave it Better Than You Found It:** If you use a piece of documentation, a tool, or a process and notice a small way it could be improved, take a moment to fix it. This principle of continuous, small improvements creates immense value over time.
* **Define Roles on Team Projects**: If you initiate a project that is too large to complete alone, your first act of "doing" is to define the needed roles and invite collaborators. The project lead is not expected to be a hero who does everything. They are a coordinator responsible for making sure that tasks are clearly defined and that volunteers have the clarity they need to contribute effectively. A project without clear roles is a project destined for last-minute chaos.
