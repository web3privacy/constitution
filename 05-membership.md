# 5. Membership

Being part of the Web3Privacy Now ecosystem can take many forms. We value all types of engagement, from financial support to active contribution. To ensure our governance remains clear and effective, we distinguish between two primary roles within our community: **Supporters** and **Members**.

## Supporters

A Supporter is anyone who aids our mission, often through financial contributions, spreading the word, or participating in public events.

* **Role:** Supporters are the lifeblood of our sustainability and our link to the wider public. Their belief in our mission provides the fuel for our work.
* **Privileges:** Supporters are valued parts of our extended community. They typically get access to exclusive content, newsletters, and a designated role in our communication channels.
* **Governance:** Supporters do not hold formal governance rights or responsibilities.

## Members: The Core Contributors

Membership is not a status that can be bought; it is a recognition of sustained, meaningful contribution. Members are the active drivers of our Intentional Do-ocracy, and only Members can participate in our governance and contributor rewards systems.

#### How to Become a Member

The path to becoming a Member is a transparent process based on recognized contribution.

1. **Demonstrable Contribution:** The candidate must have a clear public track record of contributing to the W3PN mission. This is the most important requirement. Examples include, but are not limited to:
    *  Successfully leading an initiative through the full **Intentional Do-ocracy** cycle (Dream â†’ Reflect).
    *  Making consistent, high-quality contributions to others' projects (e.g., code, design, research).
    *  Actively and constructively participating in community discussions over an extended period.

2. **Public Nomination:** An existing Member must formally nominate the candidate in a designated public channel. The nomination must include a summary of the candidate's contributions, linking to specific examples of their work.

3. **Community Consent:** The nomination is open for a **72-hour review period**, following the "Lazy Consensus" model (see Section 3). If no formal objections are raised by other Members, the nomination is considered approved by the community. An objection should be based on a belief that the candidate has not met the contribution criteria or does not align with the community's Guidelines.

4. **Steward Confirmation:** After the review period passes without objection, the Stewards perform the final administrative act of confirming the new status and updating any necessary roles or permissions.

#### Rights of a Member

Once recognized, a Member has the full governance rights outlined in this Constitution, including the right to:

* Initiate projects under Intentional Do-ocracy.
* Create a Formal Proposal.
* Formally object to a proposal during the review period.
* Participate in the election of Stewards.
* Participate in the Retroactive Contributor Rewards system (both allocating and receiving points).

#### Responsibilities of a Member

With these rights come responsibilities:

* To act in good faith and uphold the principles of this Constitution.
* To actively foster a healthy and collaborative environment.
* To use their governance rights thoughtfully and respectfully.

## Losing Membership

* **Dormancy:** Membership is not lost due to inactivity. Once a member, always a member. An inactive member simply does not participate in governance until they choose to become active again.
* **Revocation:** In extreme cases of acting in bad faith, deliberately harming the community, or violating its core principles, a Member's status can be revoked. This is a last resort and requires a Formal Proposal to be passed with a **supermajority (>=2/3rds)** vote.
